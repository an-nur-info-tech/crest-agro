                    <p class="text-justify why-us-text">CAP's Trainee farmer scheme is a hands-on program for aspiring
                        commercial farmers. Our aim is to revolutionize agriculture in Nigeria, and to bring more young
                        farmers into the commercial agricultural landscape. Through our comprehensive apprenticeship
                        program, we provide a practical, skills-based education in sustainable farming. Trainees will
                        get a unique and comprehensive education by running all aspects of cassava farming from land
                        clearing to harvesting, under the tutelage of our Farm Head â€“ an international expert in
                        commercial cassava farming
                        Over time, the best graduates of our trainee program will have the opportunity to manage their
                        own areas of farmland on a contract farming basis; creating the opportunity for economic
                        independence.

                    <p class="text-justify why-us-text">Crest Agro runs a two-tier outgrower scheme on designated areas
                        of our land.
                        Smallholders: We work local farmers to improve farming practices and yield, while guaranteeing
                        off-take of their produce by our processing plant. These farmers typically have less than 5
                        hectares, and benefit from our extension services and shared access to mechanization

                        Mid and Large Scale: Experienced farmers can apply to lease areas of a few-hundred to a few
                        thousand hectares on our land. We work with these farmers to develop a farming plan that aligns
                        with our seasonal processing needs. This is an opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs to run
                        their own agricultural business with simpler access to land and mechanization. We always
                        welcome new farmers.
