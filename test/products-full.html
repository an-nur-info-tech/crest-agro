                        We worked closely with a leading cassava starch processor from Thailand and a leading European
                        processing solutions provider and equipment manufacturer in establishing a state of the art
                        starch processing plant that will be the first of its kind in the country.
                        Our factory is on track and to commence full commercial production and trading by the third
                        quarter of 2018.

                        Crest produces high quality cassava tubers with high starch content. Our success is largely
                        attributable to selecting high yielding cassava varieties and implementing best in class
                        agronomic practices. We continue to improve on our experience by working closely with our
                        technical partners on agronomy (IITA—International Institute of Tropical Agriculture) and
                        leading commercial scale cassava farmers who are core part of our team.

                        At full scale, we will operate a captive nucleus farm along with a network of small, medium and
                        large scale outgrowers, both from our own property and from neighbouring communities.

                        We will provide our outgrowers support with inputs and training to ensure compliance with our
                        cultivation standards and requirements while also facilitating access to land, equipment and
                        financing where applicable and feasible.
